        <p class="manga">Dragon Ball is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by our late Akira Toriyama. Originally serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995. The 519 individual chapters were collected in 42 tankōbon volumes, which essentially means they combined multiple chapters into a smaller number of books. Dragon Ball was inspired by the Chinese novel Journey to the West and by Hong Kong martial arts films. It initially had a comedy focus which is visible, but later became an action-packed fighting series. <br> The story follows the adventures of Son Goku, from childhood to adulthood, as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven Dragon Balls, magical orbs which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls. <br>

            The original manga was adapted into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, which were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. A media franchise has built up around the series; among the merchandise, there have been both animated and live-action films, collectible trading card games, action figures, collections of soundtracks, and numerous video games.
            
            Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga series of all time. Its initial serialization in Weekly Shōnen Jump was partly responsible for the magazine reaching its highest circulation of 6.53 million weekly sales. Its collected tankōbon volumes have over 160 million copies sold in Japan and 260 million sold worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Reviewers have praised the manga for its comedy, fight scenes, and pacing, while recognizing a coming-of-age theme and its use of cultural references from Chinese mythology and Japanese folktales.            
            Also regarded as one of the most influential manga series, Dragon Ball has inspired numerous manga artists, including Eiichiro Oda (One Piece), Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto), and Tite Kubo (Bleach). Not only influencing manga artists, it has influenced almost everyone around the globe in many ways, almost everyone that read the Manga or watched the show has tried to become a Super Saiyan or tried to perform a Kamehameha before. <br>A sequel series, titled Dragon Ball Super, has been published in V Jump since 2015 and it is also written by Toriyama and illustrated by Toyotaro.</p>
